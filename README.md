Animal Adoption Application:
----------------------------

Objectives of the application:

Creating a Dynamic Web Application using Django Framework
Implementing CRUD Functionalities in the Application
Validate User Input
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CICD) of application through AWS CodePipeline and deployment in AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Implementing and performing static code analysis of application code in the pipeline


Application Overview:

Only an Authorized User with a valid user id will be able to surrender their pet in the shelter due to unfortunate circumstances, at the same time if the User changes their mind they can delete/edit their adoption listing
An Adopter/Benefactor will be able to Adopt a Pet from the Shelter after a proper Validation form being filled and reviewed by the admin
I have also Implemented a Pet Products Store Functionality where users will be able to purchase pet products by adding items to the cart and ordering them. 


Services Used:

Continuous Integration and Delivery â€“ I have implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate and streamline the deployment process.
Elastic Bean Stalk - AWS takes care of provisioning, configuring, and maintaining the servers, allowing you to focus on writing code and building features.
Pylint and Sonar Cloud is also used for Static Code Analysis
